# Important Note
Each of the original *.gs files have been created as *.ts (TypeScript) files.  These files, when edited and saved, should compile into *.js 
files, which would be used to update the original *.gs files in the Apps Script cloud storage.

TypeScript can easily be integrated into Visual Studio (especially from version 2013 onwards)  Alternatively, the compiler can be installed
using Node.JS NPM, and script editors such as "Atom" have very good add-ons for providing intellisense when editing the files.

The *.ts files are effectively JavaScript and everything you would write in JavaScript can also be written into a TypeScript file.
However,  TypeScript has the added advantage of allowing for more strongly typed classes and interfaces
to be created.  The reference documentation is excellent on the TypeScript web site, and definitely worth reading through.
